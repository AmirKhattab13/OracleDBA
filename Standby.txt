Convert from Physical Standby to Snapshot:
SQL> alter database recover managed standby database cancel; 						//in mount mode
SQL> select status,instance_name,database_role,open_mode from v$database,v$Instance;
SQL> SELECT THREAD# , max(sequence#) from gv$archived_log where applied='YES'  group by thread#;	//show applied archives
SQL> select flashback_on from v$database;								//optional
SQL> alter database flashback on;									//optional
SQL> alter database convert to snapshot standby;
SQL> alter database open;

Convert from Snapshot to Physical Standby:
SQL> shut immediate;
SQL> startup mount;
SQL> select status,instance_name,database_role,open_mode from v$database,v$Instance;
SQL> alter database convert to physical standby;
SQL> select status,instance_name,database_role,open_mode from v$database,v$Instance;
SQL> alter database recover managed standby database disconnect from session;


ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE CANCEL;							//stop replication
ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE DISCONNECT;						//start replication

Show The Gap:
SELECT   ARCH.THREAD# "Thread", ARCH.SEQUENCE# "Last Sequence Received", APPL.SEQUENCE# "Last Sequence Applied", (ARCH.SEQUENCE# - APPL.SEQUENCE#) "Difference"
  FROM   (SELECT   THREAD#, SEQUENCE# FROM   V$ARCHIVED_LOG WHERE   (THREAD#, FIRST_TIME) IN (  SELECT   THREAD#, MAX (FIRST_TIME) FROM   V$ARCHIVED_LOG GROUP BY   THREAD#)) ARCH,
         (SELECT   THREAD#, SEQUENCE# FROM   V$LOG_HISTORY WHERE   (THREAD#, FIRST_TIME) IN (  SELECT   THREAD#, MAX (FIRST_TIME) FROM   V$LOG_HISTORY  GROUP BY   THREAD#)) APPL
WHERE   ARCH.THREAD# = APPL.THREAD#;

You can check the gap between your primary and standby database using below query ( run this on both Primary & standby database)
SELECT THREAD# , max(sequence#) from gv$archived_log where applied='YES'  group by thread#; -- on standby
SELECT THREAD# , max(sequence#) from gv$archived_log group by thread#; -- on primary

Check Standby Processes:
SQL> select process,status,sequence# from v$managed_standby;

RFS: Remote File Server, process writes the redo data to standby redo log files on the standby database.
MRP: Managed Recovery Process, applies information from the archived redo logs to the standby database.
