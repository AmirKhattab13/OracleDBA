SRC The source host name or IP address of the client. The IP address can be a subnet, such as 192.0.2.62/24.
DST The destination host name or IP address of the database server. The IP address can be a subnet, such as 192.0.2.62/24.
ACT To accept, reject, or drop incoming requests based on the preceding three parameters. that is, accept, reject, or drop.
ACTION_LIST parameter sets attributes for a connection if it is accepted, enabling you to override 
default parameter settings on a connection-by-connection basis.


To route clients to the database server through Oracle Connection Manager, configure the tnsnames.ora file with a connect descriptor 
that specifies the protocol address of Oracle Connection Manager. This address enables clients to connect to the Oracle Connection Manager 
computer. The connect descriptor looks similar to the following:
sales=
  (DESCRIPTION=
    (ADDRESS=
      (PROTOCOL=tcp)
      (HOST=cman-pc)
      (PORT=1521))
    (CONNECT_DATA=
      (SERVICE_NAME=example.com)))

# netmgr
create service name


If the database that you want to register with Oracle Connection Manager is located on a remote node, then you must configure the cman.ora 
parameter VALID_NODE_CHECKING_REGISTRATION to allow remote registration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring Service Registration for Use with Oracle Connection Manager

1. Resolve the Oracle Connection Manager alias to a service name entry in the tnsnames.ora file as follows:
cman_listener_address =
  (DESCRIPTION=
    (ADDRESS_LIST=
      (ADDRESS=(PROTOCL=tcp) (HOST=proxy_server_name)( PORT=1521))))

2. Specify an alias for Oracle Connection Manager in the init.ora file as follows. This alias is the one 
specified in the tnsnames.ora file in step 1.

REMOTE_LISTENER=cman_listener_address

The alias must be specified because this address is TCP, port 1521 but it is not the default local listening address of TCP, port 1521 of 
the database server.	in the init.ora file:

REMOTE_LISTENER=listener_cman

3. Configure REGISTRATION_INVITED_NODES in cman.ora if the database resides on a remote node. For example:

(registration_invited_nodes=sales.us.example.com,10.245.129.60)

4. the Listener Registration (LREG) process can register database information with the Oracle Connection Manager listener. Use the 
following command to register the change:

SQL> ALTER SYSTEM REGISTER

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enabling Session Multiplexing for Oracle Connection Manager

set the DISPATCHERS parameter in the initialization parameter file (init.ora) with the attributes PROTOCOL and MULTIPLEX, 
DISPATCHERS="(PROTOCOL=tcp)(MULTIPLEX=on)"

Multiplex This parameter is used to enable session multiplexing, as follows:

If 1, on, yes, true, or both is specified, then multiplexing is enabled for both incoming and outgoing network sessions.

If in is specified, then multiplexing is enabled for incoming network sessions from the client.

If out is specified, then multiplexing is enabled for outgoing network sessions.

If 0, off, no, or false is specified, then multiplexing is disabled for both incoming and outgoing network sessions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring Oracle Connection Manager in Traffic Director Mode

Oracle Connection Manager in Traffic Director Mode is a proxy that is placed between the database clients and the database instances.

You can set up Oracle Connection Manager in Traffic Director Mode using the TDM=YES setting in the cman.ora file.

new parameters such as tdm and tdm_threading_model must be added in the cman.ora configuration file.
