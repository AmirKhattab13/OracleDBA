SQL> SELECT * From DBA_DATA_FILES;				//use DBA_TEMP_FILES for temp tablespaces

determine the name of the file for the tablespace.

SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE ADD DATAFILE

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To resolve the error when it seems space exists

SQL> select tablespace_name, total_blocks, used_blocks, free_blocks from gv$sort_segment;

find out how much temp segment space you have available to use

If free_blocks regularly shows as ‘0’, the free space for the table has been requested from other instances 
To fix this, increase the size of the temp tablespace or increase the sort_area_size or the pga_aggregate_target
