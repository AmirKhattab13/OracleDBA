What is Oracle database

1. Database Instance
2. Storage <files>

Database Instance:
1. Memory
2. Processes			//Running program

Memory:
1. SGA ==> System Global Area 	//Shared, a group of tools
2. PGA ==> Application Global Area 	//Private

SGA:
1. Shared Pool ==> Store hard parsing for sql statements, data dictionary cache "Meta Data", library cache " SQL statement"
and optimizer determine the best execution using execution plans, every plan has hash value. 

Time for data to be in memory is determined by MRU and LRU <FIFO Queue>
Most Recent Used, Last Recent Used
If you use a query frequently it will be MRU, at the beginning of queue and vice versa.

2. Streams Pool ==> Oracle streaming <data replication between 2 seperate databases>

3. Large Pool ==> Backup and recovery operations <large memory>

4. Java Pool ==> Session access database jave code

5. Database Buffer Cache ==> Fetched data from database, MRU, LRU

6. Redo Log Buffer ==> DML, transactions	//Any changes

PGA: small size for every process <private>
