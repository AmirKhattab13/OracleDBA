Real Application Clusters (RAC) Overview

Oracle RAC have a one-to-many relationship between the database and instances "up to 100 instances"
all of which access one database.

each cluster has Grid Infrastructure (GI) installed locally on each node. Grid Infrastructure 
includes several products: 
Automatic Storage Management ASM, Oracle Clusterware, and others.

Each node also requires local storage which is used to store the GI and Oracle Database software.

Each Instance in the Oracle RAC cluster accesses the database files stored on shared storage.

Each node needs at least a public interface and a private interface. Each network may use multiple 
network interface cards to increase bandwidth, availability or fault tolerance.

the public network ==> Application clients
the private network ==> Shared storage

Oracle RAC uses Oracle Clusterware for the infrastructure to bind multiple servers so they operate 
as a single system.

Oracle Clusterware also manages resources, such as Virtual Internet Protocol (VIP) addresses, 
databases, listeners, services, and so on.

Oracle Clusterware enables both noncluster Oracle databases and Oracle RAC databases to use the 
Oracle high-availability infrastructure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAC Database

A RAC database is a set of files on shared storage and can span multiple nodes. has multiple 
database Instances hosted on a RAC Cluster. These instances access a single set of Database files 
on Shared Storage.

A RAC database instance is a set of processes and memory that operates on the database files.
Shared storage is provided by an ASM instance local to the node hosting the RAC database instance.

A RAC database instance has the same memory and background processes as a single instance database, 
with the addition of Cache Fusion, and Global Processes.

Cache Fusion is a diskless cache coherency mechanism in Oracle Real Application Clusters that 
provides copies of blocks directly from a holding instance's buffer cache to a requesting 
instance's buffer cache, This provides a logical merging of the SGAâ€™s across the DB instances in 
the cluster.
uses the Private Network (Interconnect) for communication between cluster nodes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAC One Node

The main difference between Oracle RAC One Node and Oracle RAC is that with an Oracle RAC One Node 
Database, there is only one instance running at a time under normal operation. Should this one 
instance be impacted by unplanned downtime, there is a short period of time during which no 
database instance is running.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAC Tools

You administer a cluster database as a single-system image using the Server Control Utility 
(SRVCTL), Oracle Enterprise Manager, SQL*Plus, and other utilities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Database Files in RAC

Every instance must have access to all the datafiles, redo log files.
Each instance must have at least two redo log groups also called a thread.

All the Undo Tablespaces, tempfiles must be on Shared Storage.
A common (default) SPFILE with both the common parameters and instance specific parameters is 
highly recommended in shared storage.can be stored in ASM.
Some initialization parameters must be the same across all instances in a cluster, and some must be 
unique per instance.
Password file (orapwd*) may be placed in shared storage, or may be on each local node

When using ASM with normal redundancy each redo log member is mirrored, and a second Multiplexed
member is placed in a different disk group.

When create a new database, SPFILE can be in ASM disk group, cluster file system file, or a shared 
raw device.
If you manually create your database, it is recommended that you create an SPFILE from a PFILE.
You can change the SPFILE settings by using EM or ALTER SYSTEM SQL statements.

Using SPFILE simplifies administration, maintaining consistent parameter settings, and guaranteeing 
parameter settings persistence across database shutdown and startup. In addition, you can configure 
RMAN to back up your SPFILE.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TDE Keystores in RAC

Sqlnet.ora ==> contains the information (like tracing options, encryption, route of connections, 
external naming parameters etc.

Step 1: Keystore Location Setup
ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION=

 (SOURCE=

  (METHOD=FILE)

   (METHOD_DATA=

    (DIRECTORY=OS_PATH_TO_KEYSTORE)))
If the directory is not configured in the SQLNET.ORA file, then the Oracle database looks for a key
store at the default location, which is ORACLE_HOME/<Database_name>/ADMIN/ORACLE/WALLET.

Step 2: Software Keystore Creation
ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT CREATE KEYSTORE '<Keystore_location>' IDENTIFIED BY <Keystore_password>;
			//requires user password

Step 3: Open the Software Keystore
ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT SET KEYSTORE OPEN IDENTIFIED BY <Keystore_password> [Container = All | Current];

Step 4: Set the TDE Master Encryption Key
ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT SET KEY [USING TAG 'Tag'] IDENTIFIED BY <Keystore_password> [WITH BACKUP [USING 'Backup_identifier']] [CONTAINER = ALL | CURRENT];

Using clause is used for adding additional comments for the backup.

Step 5: Encrypting Data
3DES168, AES128, AES198, AES256

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Undo Tablespaces in RAC

ALTER SYSTEM SET UNDO_TABLESPACE=undotbs3 SID='RAC01';
You assign undo tablespaces in your RAC database by specifying a different value for the 
UNDO_TABLESPACE parameter for each instance in your SPFILE or individual PFILEs. if not set, each 
instance uses the first available undo tablespace.

It is highly recommended that you use the AUM - Automatic Undo Management mode. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Backup Files in RAC

Backup files in RAC have the same characteristics as in a single instance database. the backup 
files must be accessible to any instance at the time of the restore and recovery operations.
It is highly recommended that the backup files and archive log files be placed in shared storage, 
so that they are available to all instances at all times.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Listeners in RAC

SCAN - Single Client Access Name ==> a single name assigned to the cluster, DNS resolves this name 
to one of 3 or more IP address using round robin. SCAN listeners and SCAN addresses are optional, 
but recommended.

The IP addresses assigned to SCAN, are relocatable, each SCAN IP will move to an active node in the
cluster if the current node fails.

A SCAN listener is assigned to each SCAN IP. The SCAN name should be configured in DNS.

The SCAN listener receives requests and routes the requests to the Local listener.

The MGMTLISTENER allows the Cluster Health Monitor to communicate with the Grid Infrastructure 
Management Repository (GIMR). GIMR is optional, but with reduced functionality.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clustered Node

==> DB Instance, ASM Instance, Clusterware Processes, Local Disk Storage, GI Home, DB Home, OS

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cluster Configuration Options

1. Standalone Cluster ==> single cluster with local nodes hosting GI & ASM.
2. Extended Cluster ==> cluster with nodes spread over a geograohic area.
3. Cluster Domain
   - Domain Services Cluster ==> provides centralized services for a cluster domain.
   - Member Cluster ==> belongs to a Cluster Domain, recieves services from Domain Services Cluster
A standalone cluster may be converted to a member cluster.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cluster Storage Options

1. Oracle Automatic Storage Management (strongly recommended).
2. Network file system (NFS).
3. Oracle Cluster File System (OCFS2) for Linux.
4. Oracle also provides ASM Cluster File system (ACFS), which is a general purpose.
	note: You cannot put Oracle Grid Infrastructure binaries and files on ACFS.
