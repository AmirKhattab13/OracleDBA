Oracle Database Security:

To Set up Oracle TDE for database, you need to know those things:

1- Master key can be managed by two methods :-

- Oracle Wallet:- is a secure container used in Oracle databases to store and manage security credentials, such as authentication 
credentials, encryption keys, and certificates
- Hardware Security Module (HSM):-  is A physical device that provides extra security for sensitive data by managing, processing, and 
storing cryptographic keys.

2- There are three different types of wallets to consider when you use an Oracle wallet as the keystore for TDE master keys:

- Password-Based Wallet:  is an encrypted key storage file (ewallet.p12) that follows the PKCS12 standard. It is encrypted by a 
password-derived key. A human user must enter a command containing the password for the database to open the wallet, decrypt its contents, 
and gain access to keys. The password-based wallet is the default keystore for TDE master keys.

- Auto-login wallets (cwallet.sso) optionally are derived from standard password-based wallets for special cases where automatic startup of 
the database is required with no human interaction to enter a wallet password. When using auto-login wallet, the master password-based 
wallet must be preserved because it is needed to rotate the TDE master key. In addition to the best practice of storing an auto-login 
wallet in a local or network directory that is protected by tight file permissions, the file contents are scrambled by the database using a 
proprietary method for added security.

- Local Auto-Login Wallet: it has similar behavior of Auto-Login Wallet, one notable difference with local auto-login wallet is that its 
contents are scrambled using additional factors taken from the host machine where the file was created. This renders the local auto-login 
wallet unusable on other host machines, which add more extra security layer for the wallet. 

3- Master Encryption Key/ Key Encrypt Key (KEK):- 

- Master Key is a Key stored outside the Database.
- Master Key is a Key Encrypting key known as (MEK) Master Encryption Key.
- Master Key used to Encrypt the Table and Tablespace keys.
- Master Key can be generated By wallet or Key Vault or any other supported HSM (Hardware Security Modules).

4- Data Encryption Key (DEK) is two types:

A. Tablespace Key:- 
- Stored and Visible in control file and Datafile Headers
- Tablespace key used to encrypt datafiles within the tablespace
- Tablespace key encrypted by the master key

B. Table Key:- 
- Stored and Visible in table data Dictionary
- It's encrypted by master key
- Table key used to encrypt columns data within the table
 
5- By Enabling TDE you will secure your data by prevent the attacker to steal your data if he gains access through:

- Direct access to database storage
- Theft of database backup
- Compromise of database export

6- Application Can connect to the Database without any change from the application side.
