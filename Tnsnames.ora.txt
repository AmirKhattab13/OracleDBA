TNSNAMES.ORA is a configuration file that the Oracle database uses. 
It allows users and applications to connect to Oracle databases by matching a connection name with all of the relevant details.

The location of the TNSNAMES.ORA file is:
$ORACLE_HOME\network\admin\

This file contains a series of entries, where each of them represents a connection string to the database.
net_service_name =
  (DESCRIPTION=
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = <>)(PORT = 1521)
  )
  (CONNECT_DATA =
    (SERVICE_NAME=service_name)
  )
)

net_service_name: This is the name that you use for a connection string later. You can choose what this is. 
Itâ€™s like a name you give to this set of connection details.
host: The IP address or server name where the database lives or that you want to connect to.
port: The port that is required for the connection. In most cases the default port of 1521 will be fine.
service_name: This is the name of the database you want to connect to.
