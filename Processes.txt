Processes Architecture

User Process ==> On user device
Database Processes ==> Server / Background
Daemon/Application processes ==> Network listener / Grid infra daemons

Background ==> Oracle engine initiation, to handle database
Server ==> Initiate connection with Oracle server

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMON ==> every database has just 1 process, monitor system. 
# ps -ef | grep	//if there is no SMON, so database is not runinng
- Instance recovery on startup		- Clean temporary segments that are not used
- Failed transaction Recovery

PMON ==> Process Monitor, database has just 1 process, it must be running
- Server process recovery			- Clean database buffer cache
- Release resources

DBWn ==> Database Writer, one or more
- Write data from db buffer cache on data files <HD>

LGWR ==> Log Writer
- Write data from redo log buffer on redo log files <HD>
  - every 3 sec
  - commit from user
  - 1/3 of buffer is filled
Redo log files ==> min 2 files, copy of changes <for recovery>
  - low SCN
  - high SCN
  - log sequence <switch number>

ARCn ==> Archiver 
- Copy redo log files to archive log files when one redo log file is filled 

CKPTn ==> CheckPoint
- Write high SCN on header of data files and control files <checkpoint>
  - after redo log files switching
  - alter system switch log file
  - alter system checkpoint
  - using parameters
SCN: System Change Number, associated to any transaction for identifying changes. It is written in redo log file
- When high SCN in header of data file and control file < high SCN in redo log file
database was not shutdown succesfully
