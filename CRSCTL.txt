CRSCTL provides cluster-aware commands with which you can perform check, start, and stop operations on the cluster. 
You can run these commands from any node in the cluster on another node in the cluster, or on all nodes in the cluster, depending on the 
operation.

1# Starting and stopping Oracle Clusterware resources
