OLR - Oracle Local Registery

OLR is a registry similar to OCR located on each node in a cluster, but contains information 
specific to each node. and it is not shared between nodes in other word, every node has its own OLR.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Backup OLR:

The OLR location pointer file is '/etc/oracle/olr.loc' or '/var/opt/oracle/olr.loc' depending on 
platform. The default location after installing Oracle Clusterware is:

GI Cluster: <GI_HOME>/cdata/<hostname.olr>
GI Standalone (Oracle Restart): <GI_HOME>/cdata/localhost/<hostname.olr>

OLR will be backed up during GI configuration(installation or upgrade). In contrast to OCR, OLR 
will NOT be automatically backed up again after GI is configured, only manual backups can be taken. 
If further backup is required, OLR needs to be backed up manually. To take a backup of the OLR use the following command.

# <GI_HOME>/bin/ocrconfig -local -manualbackup

To List the backups currently available:
# <GI_HOME>/bin/ocrconfig -local -showbackup
# ll -ltr  /opt/app/oracle/grid/11.2.0.1/cdata/<node1>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To restore:

Be sure GI stack is completely down and ohasd.bin is not up and running, use the following command 
to confirm:
# ps -ef| grep ohasd.bin

This should return no process, if ohasd.bin is still up and running, stop it on local node:
# <GI_HOME>/bin/crsctl stop crs -f  <========= for GI Cluster

OR 

# <GI_HOME>/bin/crsctl stop has  <========= for GI Standalone

Once it's down, restore with the following command:
# <GI_HOME>/bin/ocrconfig -local -restore <olr-backup>

If the command fails, create a dummy OLR, set correct ownership and permission and retry the 
restoration command:
# cd <OLR location>
# touch <hostname>.olr
# chmod 600 <hostname>.olr
# chown <grid>:<oinstall> <hostname>.olr

Once it's restored, GI can be brought up:
# <GI_HOME>/bin/crsctl start crs   <========= for GI Cluster

OR 

$ <GI_HOME>/bin/crsctl start has  <========= for GI Standalone, this must be done as grid user

if patches are applied after the OLR is backed up, and later the backup is restored, the patch 
level will be different and GI won't start with error:
To fix the above problem, run as root user:

<GI_HOME>/crs/install/rootcrs.sh -prepatch
<GI_HOME>/crs/install/rootcrs.sh -postpatch

OCRBACKUP: +DATA:/MDPX9PRD/OCRBACKUP/

Manual backup the OCR:
# ocrconfig -manualbackup
