1) Deconfigure GI Home on Node mcdrdbadm01vm01. As ROOT -

# <GI_HOME>/crs/install/rootcrs.sh -deconfig -force -verbose

2) Detach GI Home from Node mcdrdbadm01vm01 inventory. As GRID -

$ export ORACLE_HOME=<GI_HOME>
$ <GRID_HOME>/oui/bin/runInstaller -detachHome -silent ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/21.0.0.0/grid

3) If you have sufficient free space on Node mcdrdbadm01vm01 then rename the existing GI Home. Otherwise, delete the same.

On mcdrdbadm01vm01, as ROOT -

# cd /u01/app/21.0.0.0
# mv grid grid_old (to rename)
or
# rm -rf grid (to delete)

+ Create empty directory for node addition.

# cd /u01/app/21.0.0.0
# mkdir grid
# chown grid:dba grid

4) From mcdrdbadm02vm01, check and remove Node mcdrdbadm01vm01 VIP.

As ROOT,

# srvctl config nodeapps
# srvctl status nodeapps
# crsctl stat res -t

If you see node mcdrdbadm01vm01 VIP in this list then,

# srvctl stop vip -vip <node mcdrdbadm01vm01 vip name> -f
# srvctl remove vip -vip <node mcdrdbadm01vm01 vip name> -f

(NO ACTION is required for mcdrdbadm02vm01 VIP)

5) From mcdrdbadm02vm01, delete Node mcdrdbadm01vm01

# olsnodes -s -t
# crsctl delete node -n mcdrdbadm01vm01
# olsnodes -s -t

6) Check and confirm that Node mcdrdbadm01vm01 does not have more than 1000 files under "<GI_HOME>/rdbms/audit"

If you see more than 1000 files then, please delete older files before proceeding with addnode.

7) From Node mcdrdbadm02vm01, initiate addnode

As GRID,

$ cd <GI_HOME>/addnode
$ export IGNORE_PREADDNODE_CHECKS=Y
$ export SRVM_USE_RACTRANS=true
$ ./addNode.sh -silent "CLUSTER_NEW_NODES={mcdrdbadm01vm01}" "CLUSTER_NEW_VIRTUAL_HOSTNAMES={mcdrdbadm01vm01_VIP_NAME}" -ignorePrereq

---> After binary copy to Node mcdrdbadm01vm01, it will prompt for root.sh execution on mcdrdbadm01vm01

8) Run root.sh on mcdrdbadm01vm01. As ROOT

# umask 0022
# cd <GI_HOME>
# ./root.sh

Ensure successful completion of root.sh on Node mcdrdbadm01vm01.

9) Check CRS status.
