If you are decreasing the amount of memory used by the guest, then you must first review and adjust Oracle Database memory usage and the 
operating system huge pages configuration settings in the guest:

- Review the SGA size of databases and reduce if necessary.
If you do not first reduce the memory requirements of the databases running in the guest, then the guest might fail to restart because 
too much memory is reserved for huge pages when the Oracle Linux operating system attempts to boot. 

- Review the operating system configuration and reduce the memory allocation for huge pages if necessary.

- If you modify the huge pages settings in the operating system kernel configuration file (/etc/sysctl.conf), regenerate the initramfs 
file to reflect the system configuration change.
You should backup up the existing initramfs file and then regenerate it by using the dracut command:

# ls -l /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img
-rw------- 1 root root 55845440 Jan  8 10:34 /boot/initramfs-4.14.35-2047.508.3.3.el7uek.x86_64.img

# cp /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img backup_directory

# dracut --force

If you are increasing the amount of memory used by the guest, then use the following command to determine the amount of free memory available:

# vm_maker --list --memory

# vm_maker --set --memory 32G --domain db01_guest01.example.com --restart-domain
